# k-Means Simulation Tool

Author: Steven Lio

Overview
--------

This tool is to simulate k-means algorithm with random generated data. The tool is build using Dash in Python.
scikit-leanr's k-Means algorithm is used in the simulation.

Try out the demo app [here](https://dsci532-2022-ia1-k-means.herokuapp.com/).

Manual
------

**Number of points**: 
-	Control the total number of sample points to be generated (Max 2500 points)

**Spread of the points**: 
-	Control the spread within the clusters

**Number of True Classes**: 
-	Control the number of classes to be simulated

**Number of k-Means**:
-	k clusters to be used in the k-Mean algorithm

**Random Seed**:
-	Seed for random sample generation

User can switch between **Original** or **Predictions** to compare the original and predicted classes.
